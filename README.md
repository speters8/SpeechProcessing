# SpeechProcessing
This is just an idea I had, where I wanted to look into creating a program that would show you the sound waves it hears, and be able to look at properties of the things you say.

I have yet to implement it, but I have been considering some visual effects in the case that the program detects a stop, fricative, or sonorant.

I used the Sound processing library (which I actually really like) to create the amplitude analysis.
